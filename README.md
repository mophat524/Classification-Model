## SyriaTel Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project analyzes telecom customer data to predict churn using
machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers likely to
leave and propose data-driven retention strategies.

## Dataset

-   Telecom customer dataset
-   Target variable: `Churn`
-   Features include:
    -   Demographics
    -   Tenure
    -   Contract type
    -   Monthly and total charges
    -   Services subscribed

## Methodology

1.  Data cleaning and preprocessing
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.  Feature encoding and scaling
4.  Train-test split
5.  Logistic Regression modeling
6.  Decision Tree modeling
7.  Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Key Findings

-   Customers with short tenure are more likely to churn.
-   Month-to-month contracts have higher churn rates.
-   Higher monthly charges increase churn probability.

## Business Recommendations

-   Offer incentives for long-term contracts.
-   Provide loyalty programs for new customers.
-   Use predictive scoring to proactively retain high-risk customers.
