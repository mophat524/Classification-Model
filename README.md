 Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is `bigml_59c28831336c6604c800002a.csv`, and the analysis is performed in the notebook `churn.ipynb`.

## Project Structure
  - `bigml_59c28831336c6604c800002a.csv`: Main dataset for churn prediction.
  - `churn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn



## Project Steps
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**: Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features as needed.
3. **Model Building**: Train machine learning models to predict churn.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and potential next steps.
